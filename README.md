# Email-Signature-Template
Custom HTML email signature for TokenCS team members 

To deliver this solution to a new team member:
Prepare an image of size 120x100
Open the HTML file with an editor and replace "INSERT_X" with relevant info (do not modify INSERT_IMAGE)
Provide the new team member with the following instructions, have them send a test email once they are finished

To apply this new signature:
Navigate to your signature section in gmail settings - if you can't find it  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8395?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en
Open the HTML file (double click and it will open in your browser) 
Copy everything in your browser - be sure to include the insert_image part
Paste all of this into your signature section in gmail
Highlight the INSERT_IMAGE text
Click the add media icon in the signature section and upload the attached image from this email
Be sure to save at the bottom of settings screen

Please do not edit the signature using this interface as it will break the code in the background - if you need any of the information changed in your email signature please email me and I will send you an updated HTML file
